# ClassMetaAnnotation
This package implements first class meta annotation which can be attached to classes using class side methods with the pragma #classMetaAnnotation. 

For example:
```Smalltalk
MyClass class>>specialAnnotationExample
		<classMetaAnnotation>
		^MySpecialAnnotation new
```
The declaration method should return an instance of the annotation.

There is set of messages to query declared instances of concrete annotation class:
```Smalltalk
	MySpecialAnnotation declaredInstances
	MySpecialAnnotation declaredInstancesFor: MyClass
	MySpecialAnnotation declaredInstancesDo: [:each | each logCr].
```
All annotations are cached in the Registry class variable. It is cheap to query them.

Also there is set of messages to query all attached annotation from given class:
```Smalltalk
	MyClass metaAnnotations
	MyClass metaAnnotationsDo: [:each | each logCr]
```
Because annotations are declared in the methods it provides interesting feature to extend meta information by external packages.
Just define declaration method as class extension. And when your package will be loaded the new annotation will be added into existing class.
 
There is no special way how instantiate annotation instances. It is up to the domain.

The base internal state of annotation is initialized during Registry creation.  Users should not think about it. 

You can add any domain specific variables to your annotations and add constructors to initialize them in declaration methods. 

Annotations are just normal objects without any restrictions. You can also attatch annotations to annotations like in other languages
